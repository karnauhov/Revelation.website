f you do not believe in God or if your religion is not Christianity, don’t rush to leave here. I think you did not come here by accident, and you will also be interested in what God wants to say to people.

The Book of Revelation is a book for all Christians. Jesus Christ Himself delivered this message. From the very first lines it is stated Who it is from, to whom it is addressed, and **how it should be properly handled**. 

> "Blessed is he that **readeth**, and they that **hear** the words of this prophecy, and **keep** those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." (Rev 1:3)

## Primary Sources

[This program](data:about) has been created *to help all Christians, regardless of denomination, better understand this book*. This task may seem difficult – nearly impossible, considering the differences in doctrines, cultures, customs, generations, and even Bible translations. In order to overcome all these differences accumulated over 2,000 years, let us try to get as close as possible to the time when the book was written. To this end, we will begin by reading a text as close as possible to the original. As [primary sources](data:sources) for the text, we will choose all the papyri and uncials containing the text of the Book of Revelation in the original language. Papyri are a type of ancient manuscript written on a material of the same name, and uncials are manuscripts written in large, rounded letters. There are actually few of them – only [7 papyri and 12 uncials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript). I believe that God has governed which sources of the Book of Revelation, and to what extent, have been preserved to bear witness to His Revelation.

## Principles

When studying the book of Revelation, it is wise to adhere to the principle set forth in Rev. 1:3. In fact, this verse describes the ideal model of a person’s interaction with the texts of the Holy Scriptures, highlighting three key activities:

1. ἀναγινώσκω (**to read**) – represents the first way of engagement with God’s Word: coming to know it through reading. In the context of New Testament times, this often meant public reading to the assembly of believers. Jesus frequently pointed to the importance of reading Scripture by asking, “Have you not read?” emphasizing that Scripture is meant to be known and understood. Reading is the first step toward grasping divine truths.
2. ἀκούω (**to hear / listen**) – represents the second way: the inward reception and understanding of what has been heard or read. Jesus repeatedly stressed the difference between mere physical hearing and true listening that leads to understanding (“He who has ears to hear, let him hear”). This points to a deeper level of engagement with truth, requiring not only perception but also reflection.
3. τηρέω (**to keep / observe**) – represents the third and most important way: the practical application of what has been known and understood. This is active obedience, the manifestation of faith in daily life. Jesus repeatedly emphasized that true love for Him is expressed in keeping His commandments. The term also carries the sense of “to keep” or “to guard,” implying ongoing effort and attention to fulfilling divine will.

In the words of Jesus Christ, the importance of all three aspects is particularly clear. He taught not merely the **knowledge of Scripture** (reading), but its **deep understanding** (listening), and, most importantly, its **embodiment in life** (observance). Notice that the greatest emphasis in Christ’s teaching falls on the last aspect – τηρέω (observance), as seen in numerous statements where keeping the commandments is linked with love for Him, abiding in His love, and attaining eternal life.

These three activities represent the complete model of a believer’s spiritual growth: from acquaintance with God’s Word through its internal reception to active embodiment in daily life. *The blessing mentioned in this verse is promised precisely to those who go through the entire process – from reading, through listening, to observance.*

For the practical implementation of this principle, a step-by-step study of each fragment of the Book of Revelation is proposed, where at each stage special attention is paid to the corresponding aspect of this approach. Since reading begins with working with primary sources in the original language, it is advisable to divide this activity into two stages:

### Stage 1. Forming a general text from all primary sources.

At this stage, the text of the passage is compared across all available primary sources, and **a consolidated version is created** that reflects all the differences between the sources. This process allows for the consideration of all available historical variants of the text, emphasizing the importance of each one and enabling the studied passage to be viewed from different perspectives. This is especially important for the Book of Revelation, where the diversity of textual traditions can enrich the understanding of its symbols and imagery.

### Stage 2. Dictionary and sentence structure.

This stage involves compiling a dictionary for the studied passage, working with Strong's numbers and dictionary entries for each word, as well as a detailed **grammatical analysis of each word and sentence** in accordance with the rules of New Testament Greek. This approach ensures a deep understanding of the linguistic features of the text, which is necessary for a correct interpretation of its meaning.

After reading and gaining a superficial understanding of the text, the next three stages will allow one to "hear the essence" and "see the depth and breadth" of each text.

### Stage 3. Identifying and analyzing Old Testament allusions.

This stage is critically important for a deep study of the Book of Revelation, helping to reveal its profound **connections to the Old Testament**. It aims at identifying and analyzing allusions that enrich the understanding of the text and reveal how the Old Testament is used to convey the meaning of the message. Without this analysis, the true meaning of the book may remain a mystery.

### Stage 4. The Revelation of Jesus Christ.

This central and most important stage in studying the Book of Revelation focuses on interpreting the text through the lens of Jesus Christ and the New Testament, transforming Old Testament symbols and themes in light of His life, death, and resurrection to reveal the spiritual and universal significance of the apocalyptic visions. This Christological approach emphasizes that the Book of Revelation is not just prophecies about the end times but a Christian text **centered on** **Christ and His redemptive work**, making its message relevant to the church. Without this perspective, the main significance of the book may be missed, whereas the goal of this stage is to ensure that each passage is understood as a revelation of Jesus Christ.

### Stage 5. Analysis of structure and connections.

This stage helps to see the **text in the context of the entire Book of Revelation**, establishing connections between the passage and other parts of the book, which allows for a deeper understanding of its meaning and the author's intent. The context of each passage may even be found in another part of the book, not just in adjacent passages. This underscores the importance of structural analysis for understanding the text in a broader context.
