f you do not believe in God or if your religion is not Christianity, don’t rush to leave here. I think you did not come here by accident, and you will also be interested in what God wants to say to people.

The Book of Revelation is a book for all Christians. Jesus Christ Himself delivered this message. From the very first lines it is stated Who it is from, to whom it is addressed, and **how it should be properly handled**. 

> "Blessed is he that **readeth**, and they that **hear** the words of this prophecy, and **keep** those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." (Rev 1:3)

## Primary Sources

[This program](data:about) has been created *to help all Christians, regardless of denomination, better understand this book*. This task may seem difficult – nearly impossible, considering the differences in doctrines, cultures, customs, generations, and even Bible translations. In order to overcome all these differences accumulated over 2,000 years, let us try to get as close as possible to the time when the book was written. To this end, we will begin by **reading a text** as close as possible to the original. As [primary sources](data:sources) for the text, we will choose all the papyri and uncials containing the text of the Book of Revelation in the original language. Papyri are a type of ancient manuscript written on a material of the same name, and uncials are manuscripts written in large, rounded letters. There are actually few of them – only [7 papyri and 12 uncials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript). I believe that God has governed which sources of the Book of Revelation, and to what extent, have been preserved to bear witness to His Revelation.

## Principles

When studying the Book of Revelation, it is wise to adhere to the principle set forth in Rev. 1:3. This verse highlights three key stages of engaging with the text: **reading, hearing, and keeping**. Following this advice will contribute to a better understanding of the complex prophecies of Revelation, as it is essentially a general approach to studying the Holy Scripture.
