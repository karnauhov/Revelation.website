f you do not believe in God or if your religion is not Christianity, don’t rush to leave here. I think you did not come here by accident, and you will also be interested in what God wants to say to people.

The Book of Revelation is a book for all Christians. Jesus Christ Himself delivered this message. From the very first lines it is stated Who it is from, to whom it is addressed, and **how it should be properly handled**. 

> "Blessed is he that **readeth**, and they that **hear** the words of this prophecy, and **keep** those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." (Rev 1:3)

## Primary Sources

[This program](data:about) has been created *to help all Christians, regardless of denomination, better understand this book*. This task may seem difficult – nearly impossible, considering the differences in doctrines, cultures, customs, generations, and even Bible translations. In order to overcome all these differences accumulated over 2,000 years, let us try to get as close as possible to the time when the book was written. To this end, we will begin by reading a text as close as possible to the original. As [primary sources](data:sources) for the text, we will choose all the papyri and uncials containing the text of the Book of Revelation in the original language. Papyri are a type of ancient manuscript written on a material of the same name, and uncials are manuscripts written in large, rounded letters. There are actually few of them – only [7 papyri and 12 uncials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript). I believe that God has governed which sources of the Book of Revelation, and to what extent, have been preserved to bear witness to His Revelation.

## Principles

When studying the book of Revelation, it is wise to adhere to the principle set forth in Rev. 1:3. In fact, this verse describes the ideal model of a person’s interaction with the texts of the Holy Scriptures, highlighting three key stages:

1. ἀναγινώσκω (**to read**) – represents the first stage of engagement with God’s Word: coming to know it through reading. In the context of New Testament times, this often meant public reading to the assembly of believers. Jesus frequently pointed to the importance of reading Scripture by asking, “Have you not read?” emphasizing that Scripture is meant to be known and understood. Reading is the first step toward grasping divine truths.
2. ἀκούω (**to hear / listen**) – represents the second stage: the inward reception and understanding of what has been heard or read. Jesus repeatedly stressed the difference between mere physical hearing and true listening that leads to understanding (“He who has ears to hear, let him hear”). This points to a deeper level of engagement with truth, requiring not only perception but also reflection.
3. τηρέω (**to keep / observe**) – represents the third and most important stage: the practical application of what has been known and understood. This is active obedience, the manifestation of faith in daily life. Jesus repeatedly emphasized that true love for Him is expressed in keeping His commandments. The term also carries the sense of “to keep” or “to guard,” implying ongoing effort and attention to fulfilling divine will.

In the words of Jesus Christ, the importance of all three aspects is particularly clear. He taught not merely the **knowledge of Scripture** (reading), but its **deep understanding** (listening), and, most importantly, its **embodiment in life** (observance). Notice that the greatest emphasis in Christ’s teaching falls on the last aspect – τηρέω (observance), as seen in numerous statements where keeping the commandments is linked with love for Him, abiding in His love, and attaining eternal life.

These three stages represent the complete model of a believer’s spiritual growth: from acquaintance with God’s Word through its internal reception to active embodiment in daily life. *The blessing mentioned in this verse is promised precisely to those who go through the entire process – from reading, through listening, to observance.*
